How to run this project:

  * Make sure you have installed docker. https://www.docker.com
  * Make sure docker compose is installed on your machine. https://docs.docker.com/compose
  * Make sure docker machine is installed in case you want to host your docker in DIGITAL  Ocean or AWS.  https://docs.docker.com/machine/
  * After all that , navigate to the cloned project and just write
  > docker-compose up

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## NOTES
  * Will write an article on how to Dockerlize a phoenix project soon.
